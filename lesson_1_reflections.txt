How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

  well 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can easilly understand the changes what I made and if they are wrong I can apply fix.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

   we can have an clear idea of the purpuse of the change. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Since, in some languages change occure in 2 or 3 files for a single bug fix.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log
    git diff first_commit_id second_commit_id

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Since, I make commits using comments and I can checkout from that point.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    for developing projects easily
